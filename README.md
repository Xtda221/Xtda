This Free App Is An EXE File, Click Switch And You Gonna Put The "Epic Game" Folder Located In The C Drive or Others, Click Switch To Offline Again.
This Gonna Make The Launcher Switch You To Offline While You Are Online But No Body Gonna See You. Friend And Others Going To See
You Offline While You Are Playing Or Something. " if You Tired Of Invites And Messages In-Game... Then Use It! ".
